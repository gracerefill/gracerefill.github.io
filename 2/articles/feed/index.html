<blockquote>
<p>Aside from being one of the best days of your life, your wedding will also be one of the most emotional</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you aren’t a natural-born event planner, all the organisation and project management can be overwhelming. Everything you feel seems heightened; if you’re happy it feels more like delight… and equally so, if something upsets you it feels like the end of the world. This is why you, as the bride-to-be, need to consider your “wedding squad” very carefully.  Everyone that you choose as wedding suppliers (and yes, that includes your retinue) must be committed to one thing above all else: your peace-of-mind, not only on the day but during the lead-up too.  Not to cause you any added anxiety, but this day really is about you (and your Prince Charming, of course), so it’s very important that you feel comfortable with your team of trusted advisors. Someone who has built his entire business around this understanding, is the renowned and highly sought-after wedding photographer, Warren James.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Warren and his team are recognised and respected for their deep connections that they forge with their brides, and clients in general.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From boudoir shoots to wedding days, the whole experience is always defined by a relaxed sense of fun and familiarity, with phenomenal photography as a natural outcome.  This is the very essence of Warren James. “In the years of my career as a professional photographer, I’ve seen amazing things through my lens and heard many questions that almost every bride asks,” explains Warren.  In this series of <strong>#WeddingWisdom</strong> posts, Warren will be sharing his rare observations from behind-the-scenes – or in his case, behind-the-lens. “Because I’m intent on being my bride’s right-hand man, no disrespect to the groom, my mission is to assure you every step of the way, so let’s start with five of the most frequently asked questions.”</p>
<h2>1. I’M NOT A MODEL AND I’M WORRIED THAT MY AWKWARDNESS WILL RUIN THE PHOTOS</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12188" src="../wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spread-13.jpg" alt="Story Telling" width="1570" height="600" srcset="http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spread-13.jpg 1570w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spread-13-300x115.jpg 300w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spread-13-768x294.jpg 768w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spread-13-1024x391.jpg 1024w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spread-13-1080x413.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1570px) 100vw, 1570px" /></p>
<p>Almost all the couples I work with have some level of phobia being infront of the camera. To some it is only a slight concern that their hair and outfit looks great, to others, they would rather be in the dentist chair than being &#8220;posed&#8221; infront of a camera lens. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I make it my mission to be sure that every person I photograph feels relaxed and confident, while having fun taking photo&#8217;s with me. </strong></span></p>
<p>I see my job as being the narrator and visual story-teller of your wedding day. I make it a priority to grok what makes my your story unique and also what makes you feel confident and relaxed while we make pictures together. I am intent on capturing individual personalities as much as I am on capturing the perfect shot. It’s all about making my clients feel confident &amp; unique, and then capturing it all on camera.</p>
<p>You’ll be amazed by the magic that naturally happens when my clients are relaxed and not only looking, but also <em>feeling</em> like they’re living happily ever after! The rest is up to me, so let’s tell your story together.</p>
<h2>2. SO NOW I’M ENGAGED, WHAT’S THE NEXT STEP?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12217" src="../wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wjp-07-1024x391.jpg" alt="Urban Couple Shoot" width="1024" height="391" srcset="http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wjp-07-1024x391.jpg 1024w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wjp-07-300x115.jpg 300w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wjp-07-768x294.jpg 768w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wjp-07-1080x413.jpg 1080w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wjp-07.jpg 1570w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pre-wedding shoot is all about story-telling, fantasy and having lots of fun!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as photography is concerned, there are several photographic milestones leading up to your wedding day. First there’s the fun and exciting pre-wedding shoot which could possibly be your first professional photo shoot together as a couple. Now that it’s official you’ll want to show off your love (and your glittering ring) to the world. This is also your opportunity for you as a couple to form a relationship with your photographer and start to get more comfortable interacting with each other. This insight will help your photographer to look out for and capture those unique and intimate moments on your wedding day.</p>
<p> <img src="http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/17Feb11_182814-Edit.jpg" width="2600" height="809" alt="Eshoot" class="wp-image-12649 aligncenter size-full" srcset="http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/17Feb11_182814-Edit.jpg 2600w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/17Feb11_182814-Edit-300x93.jpg 300w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/17Feb11_182814-Edit-768x239.jpg 768w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/17Feb11_182814-Edit-1024x319.jpg 1024w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/17Feb11_182814-Edit-1080x336.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 2600px) 100vw, 2600px" /></p>
<p>Typically the pre-wedding shoot captures where you are in your lives as a couple. First you need to decide which setting will be the perfect backdrop for your unique story. Maybe it’s on the university campus where you met, or in the restaurant where you had your first date, or even in an amusement park because fun is what you’re all about as a couple. <strong>One of the biggest objectives of this shoot is for your photographer to reassure you, that he can make you feel comfortable in any environment so that you’re not confronted with any awkwardness on the day.</strong> Your wedding day shoot is the culmination of all this – the final opportunity to capture every moment authentically as it happens.  I like to look out for the moments between the moments. Your wedding will feel like it’s gone in blur, so it’s your photographer’s job to capture every step of the journey.</p>
<h2>3. DO YOU HAVE A SIGNATURE STYLE?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12209" src="../wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wjp-05.jpg" alt="Romantic Wedding Photography" width="1570" height="600" srcset="http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wjp-05.jpg 1570w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wjp-05-300x115.jpg 300w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wjp-05-768x294.jpg 768w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wjp-05-1024x391.jpg 1024w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wjp-05-1080x413.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1570px) 100vw, 1570px" /> Yes, I fall into the category of a “romantic” photographer – just as well I decided to become a wedding photographer, hey? But seriously though, my photographic instinct is highly technical and I see opportunities and angles that other photographers generally don’t see.  The composition, lighting, and acute attention to detail are all signatures of my fairy-tale style and are evident in every shot and every wedding album.</p>
<h2>4. CAN I BRING YOU REFERENCE PICS OF PARTICULAR SHOTS I WANT INCLUDED?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12187" src="../wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spread-18.jpg" alt="Wedding Album" width="1570" height="600" srcset="http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spread-18.jpg 1570w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spread-18-300x115.jpg 300w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spread-18-768x294.jpg 768w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spread-18-1024x391.jpg 1024w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spread-18-1080x413.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1570px) 100vw, 1570px" /> Of course, by all means, but know that I’ll always push for a unique take on the concept. My wedding photography is bespoke and distinctly devoid of cliched shots. After all, that’s why my brides choose me as their photographer.  I will always listen to your ideas though, and then interpret them into a final product that is unmistakably and confidently unique.</p>
<h2>5. WHAT HAPPENS IF IT POURS ON THE DAY?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12186" src="../wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spread-17.jpg" alt="Wedding Rain" width="1570" height="600" srcset="http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spread-17.jpg 1570w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spread-17-300x115.jpg 300w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spread-17-768x294.jpg 768w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spread-17-1024x391.jpg 1024w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spread-17-1080x413.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1570px) 100vw, 1570px" /> I know that it’s supposed to be a sign of good luck, but having the rain pour down just as you make your big entrance hardly feels lucky! But it’s really not as bad as it seems.  The rain often provides the opportunity for some pretty amazing shots.  By back lighting the rain drops and looking for reflections in puddles I’m able to capture a different kind of romance that only adds to the final product. I do recommend, however, that my brides discuss an indoor/rain plan option with the venue before booking it.  The season you choose to get married in and time of the day will also play a big role in the likelihood of rain. Next in our series of Warren’s #WeddingWisdom we’ll be featuring the services of other wedding suppliers.  For instance, what are the top 5 things you need to know about choosing the dress and the flowers and the cake?  Because of his unique perspective from behind the lens, Warren is able to offer an objective and valuable opinion on all things wedding as a trusted supplier and friend.</p>

<p>It was amazing to watch someone with such an artistic eye at work, capturing our day so effortlessly. Not only were the pictures stunning, but you were such a lovely presence to have around, which I feel allowed you to catch people at their best, as they were always happy to see you.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2>Your timeline is a critical part of your wedding planning.</h2>
<p>Among all the fussing, flowers, food and festivities there are 2 people at your wedding day that are the most important, the wedding couple! <em><strong>Your wedding planning should be centred around this single fact.</strong></em></p>
<p>The advice I would like to give to you, the bride and groom, is that you need to decide what are your most important priorities and mould your wedding planning accordingly. After all, your wedding day centres around you and celebrating the lifelong commitment you are making to one another.</p>
<p>In South Africa wedding schedules have become as standard as Getting Ready | Ceremony | Family Shoot | Bridal Party Shoot | Couple Shoot | Reception. Although this works I have seen how many times my clients get stressed and flustered when things start to delay. Here are some ideas and things to think about that you can use to make your wedding day schedule a little more flexible, enjoyable and stress free.</p>
<h2>Great photography requires time</h2>
<p>After many years of doing wedding photography, we have learnt to adapt to tight schedules and fit portrait sessions into crammed time-slots. This however is not ideal when working on a creative and enjoyable photography experience. Almost anything can be done on a wedding day to create beautiful, elegant and creative photographs. The biggest limiting factor however is time. All of our packages allow for a typical wedding day to be captured should you follow our suggested timelines. If your ceremonial or social activities require more than 8 hours you can purchase additional time for your wedding without having to take a larger package. With that said we always recommend allowing as much time for photography as what your budget allows, the more time we have to snap away the more we are able to photograph for you.</p>
<p><strong><em>I encourage all of my clients to take the timing of the day into consideration when building the expectations for your photography. Your wedding day only happens once, let’s do it right.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Before I give you some suggested timelines, here are some points that you should take into consideration:</em></p>
<h2>The No 1 reason for the wedding schedule being late.</h2>
<p>I can happily confirm that most of the weddings that I attend do run on time. However, if a wedding does run late, the main reason is hair &amp; makeup runs behind schedule. This tends to happen for a number of reasons, and not all of them are the service providers fault. There are times when a family member or bride&#8217;s maid wants changes made to their styling, or, they have a difficult skin type or hair style that takes more time than planned!</p>
<p><strong>The biggest problem comes in here:</strong> They always want to work on the <em><strong>bride last</strong></em>! I get it, this will mean that the makeup is fresh when the bride walks down the isle. Read further to find the reasons why I recommend not having your schedule work this way.</p>
<h2>The No 2 reason for the wedding schedule being late.</h2>
<p>No Dress = No wedding. If someone else is bringing your dress or suit and they run late, then so do you. The rule that I recommend is that the dress, shoes, veil and other apparel goes wherever the bride and groom goes. I have seen on more than one occasion someone driving more than 50km to fetch a veil or dress last minute.</p>
<h1>Tips to keep your wedding schedule on time.</h1>
<p>In my experience letting the hair and makeup crew know that you have to be in your dress and ready to go 30-60min before the actual time alleviates tons of stress on the day. If for some amazing reason they finish on time (and every now and again there are some that do) then you will be able to relax with your friends, sip on a drink and take it all in.</p>
<h2>The first look</h2>
<p>Have your couple photo session before your ceremony! Here is why I confidently suggest this to my clients:</p>
<p><em>I have seen how many times it actually makes my client’s day much more enjoyable. </em></p>
<p>To illustrate the above, let me ask you this question…. The minute you kiss as a married couple for the first time and walk down the aisle to meet your beloved guests how are you going to feel and what are you going to want to do? … Celebrate and enjoy your marriage with family and friends.</p>
<p>Although a photo session with us is fun and exciting, it still cannot compare to hanging out with all your loved ones as a newly married couple straight after you have tied the knot.</p>
<h3>Benefits of a pre-ceremony photo-session:</h3>
<ul>
<li>When you see each other for the first time we can photograph the bride and grooms reaction in a place other than the opposite ends of the isle, which is often a better perspective.</li>
<li>You don’t have to wait till after the ceremony to talk to each other after seeing each other for the first time.</li>
<li>Family images are easier and quicker to organize before the ceremony than after.</li>
<li>You get to enjoy the cocktail hour with your guests and family.</li>
<li>If the ceremony runs late there is no stress about the lack of light.</li>
<li>Images of cocktail hour with your guests.</li>
<li>Allows photographers to photograph your venue during your cocktail hour – The way it will look just before your guests enter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further to all the above, if you would like a sunset shot it would mean that we could quickly nip off for 15 to 20 minutes just before the sun goes down. By this time you have spent time celebrating with friends and family, and had the time to enjoy a drink yourself.</p>
<h2>Sunset &amp; weather cannot be changed</h2>
<p>When setting the timings for the day start off with the fixed elements and work backwards or forwards until all the pieces of the jigsaw fall into place. Decide if you want a sunset shot (Weather taken into consideration) and work backwards from there.</p>
<h2>Ceremony duration</h2>
<p>I’ve had the pleasure of attending many different types of ceremonies from a variety of religions. Be sure to check with your respective officiant how long they expect the ceremony to be. Different ceremonies will have required different amounts of time. A civil ceremony could range between 15 to 30 minutes whilst an whilst traditional or orthodox ceremony could easily exceed an hour.</p>
<p>When planning the ceremony duration please keep in mind the time spent before the ceremony as well as the congratulations and signing of the register after the ceremony. This would also be an ideal time to decide if you would like a large group shot of all your guests. Please allow an additional 10 minutes for this.</p>
<h2>Formal Group &amp; Family Pictures</h2>
<p>Family pictures and group shots by far take the most amount of time due to the fact that you are dealing with many different people. If you’ll be having your family images before the ceremony I would allocate about 15 &#8211; 20 minutes. If you will be having them after your ceremony working out the time to allocate for family photographs will be hard but as a rough guide allocate 5 mins for the first family photograph and then two to three minutes for each family photograph after that.  I would allocate about 30 – 40 minutes after the ceremony depending on how many family images you want.</p>
<p>A VERY GOOD suggestion is to appoint your Master of Ceremonies or other able family member to co-ordinate the people required for the formal family photographs. Compile a list and have this person round up the required people and to have them readily available. <strong>Remember, your photographer in most cases does not know who is family and who are friends.</strong> By having someone co-ordinate, the process goes faster and allows more alone portrait time with the photographer.</p></div>

<p><strong>Your boudoir session should be viewed a fun and enriching part of your overall wedding experience.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em;"><img src="http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/18Aug10_142912-2-1-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt="" class="wp-image-12606 alignleft size-medium" srcset="http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/18Aug10_142912-2-1-200x300.jpg 200w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/18Aug10_142912-2-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/18Aug10_142912-2-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/18Aug10_142912-2-1-1080x1620.jpg 1080w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/18Aug10_142912-2-1.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" />If you like the idea of adding a bridal boudoir photography session to your wedding photography experience I offer the following advise and guidelines:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Allow a <strong>dedicated</strong> 30-45 min in your wedding program for the shoot.</li>
<li>Schedule the shoot after your hair and make-up has been done (A good time to do the shoot is while hair and make-up is being done on the other girls)</li>
<li>Get some inspiration. A simple google search “wedding boudoir” will bring up plenty of inspiration for your photography session. Feel free to bring the images along on your phone or email them to me before your wedding day. This will give me a good idea of what images appeals to you and I can style the shoot accordingly.</li>
<li>Lets keep distractions and fuss to a minimum. I do not recommend having too many people accompanying the shoot. However, I do require you to be accompanied by at least one other woman that you are comfortable around (Mother or bridesmaid).</li>
<li>Keep a robe handy. I advise you to have a plain coloured robe or nighty available for practicality and comfort.</li>
<li>Feel free to use this as the perfect excuse to go buy yourself some underwear you love!<img src="http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/18Aug10_144904-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt="" class="wp-image-12586 alignright size-medium" srcset="http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/18Aug10_144904-200x300.jpg 200w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/18Aug10_144904-768x1152.jpg 768w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/18Aug10_144904-683x1024.jpg 683w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/18Aug10_144904-1080x1620.jpg 1080w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/18Aug10_144904.jpg 1733w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></li>
<li>Let us know what parts of your body you or your future hubby likes most. This might be eyes, smile, legs, bottom, chest, tummy, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are very shy, feel free to specify the level of nudity that you are comfortable with beforehand. <strong style="font-size: 1em;">Full nudity is never an option and not suited for bridal boudoir.</strong><span style="font-size: 1em;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">Here are a few suggestions.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Robe or nighty with lingerie underneath (Covered at all times)</li>
<li>Lingerie (This will include top and bottom)</li>
<li>Topless with bottoms (We totally understand that you are not a professional underware model! We guide you in a stylish fashion to cover your breasts when required using your hands, pillow, hair etc. The benefit for you with this option is natural skin amplifies softness and feminity in an image. When we are not clicking the shutter you will be fully covered)</li>
</ul>
<p><em style="font-size: 1em;"><strong>Lastly&#8230;. Have fun!!</strong></em><span style="font-size: 1em;"> Like any of our other photography sessions we will do our best to make sure that you are relaxed &amp; <span>having fun </span>during your shoot. We will pose you when needed but remember that this session is about celebrating you and your hubby that is eagerly waiting for you on the other end of that isle!</span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><strong> </strong><span><strong>We only offer this service to clients who have already booked a wedding with us.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>E-mail us for current rates on wedding boudoir sessions (You should have our email address at this stage, we try to avoid spam.)</strong></span></p></div>

<p style="text-align: left;" align="JUSTIFY">The day a girl come of age and her visits to wedding events make her fantasize about a matchless wedding day where she would be walking arm-in-arm with her lovely groom through the aisle in church with the guests rising to praise her. As leading Gauteng-based Wedding photographers we understand the need for flawlessness.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">We all know a wedding ceremony is considered one of the most sacred days in all the cultures of the world. Since this ceremony holds a very special significance in your life, everything should be prepared without any hassles. Floral décor, the reception venue, catering services, DJ other paraphernalia must NEVER become subject to your guests negative comments. Arranging a wedding event is as hard as arranging a public event. A single guest being unhappy would mean there was some kind of shortcoming in preparations.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Since the event is such an undertaking, a professional wedding photographer is the obvious choice if you at all wish to have the event captured and preserved properly. You cant be worried about taking pictures of something you are supposed to be enjoying more than your guests. You cant be expected to enjoy your day when you have other issues on your mind. Appointing a wedding photographer of a deeper aptitude and experience is vital. We assure you that our honest service will make your event worth remembering. We know how people feel when they look back and think about the old, sweet memories of their wedding.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="JUSTIFY">As far as quality is concerned, we never take it for granted or compromise with anything. The value of clients’ investment is reflected in our services. Catering to your considerations, we offer personalized wedding photography that meets all your needs, preferences and requirements.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As professional Gauteng-based wedding photographers, our job is not confined to capturing pictures on the day. You aren&#8217;t paying for just mere photos. The most important processes take place in post-production. This includes editing, colouring, re-touching and print mastery, among others. Its worth everything when you receive your images and it just supersedes your expectations. Trust us&#8230; you will reminisce your special day.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Getting the right wedding photos is a vital component to the accomplishment of the most significant day of your life. Please contact us today for quality wedding photography services and get your golden moments captured in a beautiful album.</p></div>

<h2>Posing should be fun!</h2>
<p>After years of waiting for your perfect match you can now look forward to one of the best days of your life. Sourcing the best wedding photographers for your wedding needs are of paramount importance. <img class="wp-image-11354 alignleft size-medium" src="../wp-content/uploads/2017/08/17Apr08_153732-300x200.jpg" alt="Fujifilm X-Camera" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/17Apr08_153732-300x200.jpg 300w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/17Apr08_153732-768x512.jpg 768w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/17Apr08_153732-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/17Apr08_153732-610x407.jpg 610w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/17Apr08_153732-1080x720.jpg 1080w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/17Apr08_153732.jpg 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Not only would your photographers understand posing in all it&#8217;s glorious technicality, but <em><strong>your wedding photographers should also make you look your very best while still being a super fun, easy and unforgettable experience.</strong> </em>You will often find an over emphasis on either the technical or the intuitive parts of wedding photography. To find wedding photographers that have the ability to marry both is worth his\her weight in gold! At Warren James Photography, this is one of the things that we do best!</p>
<p>We understand how intimidating it could be to have a lens stare at you in wondrous neutrality. We get it, you are pretty much as comfortable as a bottle nose dolphin would be swimming through the Karoo. Therefore, we have compiled the following list of tips for your consideration. After all, nobody wants to be looking like a shop-front mannequin on your wedding photos.</p>
<p>With us, your photo experience is motivated by the visual results of love, romance and joy. You will be invited to encounter your partner in a natural and authentic way while we capture your picture-perfect moments. Here are a couple of easy to digest secrets regarding posing and looking your best in your wedding dress.</p>
<h3>1. Posture, posture &amp;&#8230; posture.</h3>
<p>Shoulders back, chin out! Don’t slouch, it doesnt look cool in a wedding dress. By keeping your shoulders back and chest out, it will allow for a flattering posture. Wedding dresses can be heavy, but that shouldnt get you down. Keeping your chin out avoids the &#8216;double chin&#8217; effect and will make your neck look longer, more feminine and elegant. A gentle reminder from your wedding photographer, to correct your posture, will be appreciated for many years to come. </p>
<h3>2. When holding your bouquet.</h3>
<p>Weddings are mady up of small details that come together to showcase the big picture. When you hold your bouquet (or anything else for that matter) it should look and feel natural. You should ask yourself “would it be comfortable to hold this thing like this for half an hour?”. As a general rule elbows should not be held at 90 degree angles and your wrists should not be angled outward (But don’t worry we will be looking out for this anyway).</p>
<h3>3. Balance &amp; Curves  </h3>
<p>Keep it curvy! It is always a good idea to keep your weight on one leg and usually this should be the leg furthest from the camera. This gives your body its great and naturally lavish shape. If you are very slim and would like to accentuate your bodies curves, simply push out your hip just a little more. Keep your posture upright to avoid looking un-balanced.<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/10/150117-185347.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-2434 size-full" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/10/150117-185347.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="700" srcset="http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/150117-185347.jpg 467w, http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/150117-185347-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /></a></p>
<h3>4. Smile Naturally</h3>
<p>Let your smile reflect what words find immeasurable. Don’t feel that you need to smile in every picture as a smile should come naturally and not rehearsed. We feel that a wide scope of emotions should be captured during a wedding day. This could be anything from a quiet moment shared or a spontaneous instant of laughter. </p>
<h3>5. Trust your photographer</h3>
<p>Allow us to do what we do best&#8230; Take photos that woo you. It is our privilege to keep you looking at your very best in your wedding photos.</p>
<h3>6. Have Fun (This is our top tip)</h3>
<p>Remember beautiful pictures are not about striking the perfect pose. Relax and have fun on your wedding day, if you have chosen the right photographer your wedding pictures will speak for themselves.</p>
<p>We cannot wait to share the excitement and reward that awaits you when you receive your final wedding album, artfully designed and adorned with photographs of what could only be a picture perfect bride…You.</p>

<h2><em>Hiring a Professional Wedding Photographer:</em></h2>
<p>Almost every young girl at one time or another, dreams of the perfect wedding day. From the flowers to her bridesmaids, the reception venue to the ceremony all those finer details are thought of years in advance. Such meticulous planning deserves careful and considered execution, and deserves to have proficient professional wedding photographers to capture all those moments vividly.</p>
<p>Hiring a wedding photographer of talent and experience is essential. You shouldn&#8217;t just choose the first photographer that you see neither should you plump for the photographer with the cheapest rates. It’s a decision to take some care with, after all you want to look back on your wedding day in decades to come and enjoy vivid photographs that perfectly encapsulate the emotion and celebration of the day.</p>
<p>Here are a few top tips that we help you secure superlative wedding pictures that you’ll be proud of for years to come.</p>
<h2><i>Quality costs more because it’s worth more<img class=" size-medium wp-image-1365 alignright" src="http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Warren-James-Photography-1-300x199.jpg" alt="Warren James Photography (1)" width="300" height="199" /> </i></h2>
<p>As with anything else, quality comes at a premium cost. Consider the expense of hiring an amateur to complete work of any nature on your behalf. The prices quoted will reflect the quality of service. Reputable and accomplished professional wedding photographers will inevitably command higher rates. True, everyone needs to start somewhere and when planning any wedding the budget must always be considered, but, as the bride and groom, you get one attempt at capturing your wedding. Choose the photographer that you feel is most appropriate for your needs.</p>
<h2><i>How to tell professionals from amateurs</i></h2>
<p>This will mean undertaking some research, but in truth would you choose  to purchase any significant product or service without undertaking substantial research? The good news is that a good wedding photographer can easily be distinguished from a poor wedding photographer. Always ask for a portfolio of their previous work. Look at contrast, composition, subject matter and quality of the prints. Professional wedding photographers will always take pride in every aspect of their work, from equipment to print material.</p>
<p><strong><i>Top Tip: </i>If the photographer is able to answer all your questions with knowledge and experience then they have been doing this for a while. If the photographer is short of knowledgeable answers or avoids giving direct answers to your questions then there may be reason for concern.</strong></p>
<h2><i><a href="http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Warren-James-Photography-2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1366" src="http://warrenjames.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Warren-James-Photography-2-300x199.jpg" alt="Warren James Photography (2)" width="300" height="199" /></a>The other reasons to hire professional wedding photographers</i></h2>
<p>A professional wedding photographer’s work is not over once your wedding day has concluded. You’re not just paying for their talent and time on the day, most wedding photographers will factor in any time needed to edit or retouch the photographers at their studio. This may be a long process, though it will be worth the wait when you look lovingly on the photos for years to come.</p>
<p>Getting the right wedding photos is an essential ingredient to the success of the most important day of your life. Remember that you only get one chance. Choose a professional wedding photographer to capture all those wonderful moments throughout the course of your day.</p></div>
